<h3>Caesar Cipher</h3>
Implement a caesar cipher that takes in a string and the shift factor and then outputs the modified string.
A caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a
letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

<h3>Sub Strings</h3>
<p>Implement a method #substrings that takes a word as the first argument.</p>
<p>It should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive)</p>
<p>letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.</p>
<p>that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.</p>

<h3>Stock Picker</h3>
<p>Implement a method #stock_picker that takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day.</p>
<p>It should return a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell. </p>
<p>Days start at 0. You need to buy before you can sell</p>

<h3>Bubble Sort</h3>
<p>Build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array.</p>
<p>using the bubble sort method where each element is compared to the one next</p>
